OSOR Forge by Roberto Andradas Izquierzo
=========================================

Brief History
==============

Open Source Observatory Repository (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/osor.eu) - FLOSS Forge oriented to European Public Administration. Giving a technic base and guidelines to develop FLOSS projects throught good practices. Only Public Administrations funded FLOSS project can be hosted in OSOR you can not advertise a project by yourself.

The project started in 2007 and in December 2011 migrated to JoinUP (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/osor.eu) the new development platform.

Development Tools
==================

Main goal is to create Communities for each FLOSS project thus create an environment in a common place to all Public Administration developments.

Gforge http://gforge.com/gf/ - Base for the FLOSS Forge that became Fusion Forge in 2009 (http://blog.bitergia.com/2012/11/16/the-history-of-fusionforge-and-gforge/). Strong communication with Gforge community.
Repository - Subversion
CMS Service for users - Plone CMS (http://plone.org/)
Mailing list - GNU Mailman (http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/).

I couldn't found more information about development tools for the project.

How to contribute
==================

Well, the project ended in December 2011 so is not possible to collaborate in this project, there is no community supporting the project.

There is a quick view of spread and create a community.
