GNOME is an acronym that means: GNU Object Model Environment. 

Brief History

Was created in 1997 through the visible momentum of Miguel de Icaza (http://tirania.org/blog/) to provide graphical desktop environments completely FLOSS Linux version. Counteract the existing KDE fed on QT (at that time was proprietary software, not now).

After some analysis they start developing GNOME using GTK (Gimp Toolkit, yes Gimp GNU Image Manipulation Program (http://www.gimp.org/) :)).

GNOME Foundation was founded on 15 August 2000 by Compaq, Eazel, Helix Code, IBM, Red Hat and Sun Microsystems. Manages GNOME development and represents GNOME worldwide.

Technologies

GNOME is developed using C language and Object Oriented GTK+ library.

Each project/module is governed by these basic development tools:

Maintainer - benevolent dictator for life for each module
Mailing list - Encourage users to develop discussions in mailing list instead of IRC because it is easier to manage the history of the decisions made.
Bug Tracking System - Bugzilla
Documentation - Wiki is a very useful tool in project development because brings information from the project and its easier to use as a collaborative document development for technical and non-technical users.
Repository - Distributed repository git in git.gnome.org
Synchronous communication - IRC channel to retrieve information and ask questions related to GNOME.
Quality and Assurance - Users, the users are the best QA team for Gnome.

Development process

Six months release cycles - Functionality Oriented Releases vs Time-Based Release Schedule (https://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/TimeBased). Stabilization to complete a functionality release, develop and complete functionalities freezing incomplete modules.
Coordinated by Release Team
Schedule - Develop release schedule for each iteration (https://live.gnome.org/Schedule)
Feature proposal period - guided freezing developments (https://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/Freezes)
    The Freeze - 
    String Freeze - 
    Hard Code Freeze - No new code
All freezes except the hard code freeze remain in the stable branch after the final stable release. Stable branch fixes new bugs from freeze code to release.

Whole process is available to users in release-notes section (https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.6/)
How to Contribute

GNOME Community has a low barrier entrance guided by Meritocracy.

Reasonable number of patches in a module.
Ask for commit rights to Accounts Team
Accounts Team contact module maintainer or translator coordinator to check for approval.
A committer can commit to git repository but her contributions have to be reviewed and approved by maintainer of the module
Important: committers have write access to all git repositories hosted in git.gnome.org. You can contribute to all modules. If you find an error you could fix and commit the patch.

Maintainers are responsible for the module. They have to review patches and assume results, their role is important inside the community. Communications and releases are managed by maintainers. Could be various maintainers for each module.

Instead of translators that in translation modules committers are maintainers for themselves because a translation can't be reviewed because it would duplicate the work again. So you have full confidence in the translation module.
