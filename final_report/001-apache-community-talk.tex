\\ This is a summary of \textit{Santiago Gala}'s presentation about Apache Software Foundation (video presentation is in the bottom of the page).
\\
\\\textit{Apache Software Foundation} - \textbf{ASF} - \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.283.29}{501.3 epigraph C nonprofit Foundation}
\\
\\ ASF defines itself as:
\\
\begin{quotation} not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.
\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{ What is a foundation? Why Apache became a foundation?.} A \textit{Foundation} is a legal umbrella to allow us to legality providing transparency.
\\
\\ Apache became a foundation (ASF) in 1999 for:
\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Protection.
	\item Client support, official and legal.
	\item Protect Apache brand.
	\item Legally accept donations and manage resources.
	\item Insulates volunteers legal attacks by clients.
	\item Defense brand.
\end{itemize} And added a \textit{"personal"} statement:
\\
\begin{quotation}\textit{No more than half of the money can come from a single company.}
\end{quotation} To avoid monopoly.
\\

\subsubsection{ Volunteers contributions} Apache could be defined as a community of communities. Therefore contributors enter for each community through its rules. The basic rules are inherited and common from ASF.
\\ To make a contribution, first, the contributor must be in contact with the particular community and its ecosystem project.pse, EUPL, FLOSS, FLOSSIE, flos
\\ In Apache projects bear a similarity in ecosystems, because they have been through an acceptance process to be adopted or published by Apache.
\\ As each project is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Mailing lists}.
	\item \textit{Source code}.
	\item \textit{Bug tracking}.
	\item \textit{Mentors}.
	\item \textit{Committers}.
	\item \textit{Documentation} (wikis, html, pdf...).
\end{itemize} Therefore, in order to help you to follow the guidelines set. It is recommended in all FLOSS projects you can register for mailing lists as a first step to find out how it works and basic communication. Then begin to understand the design, installation, use and testing.
\\ You can read a summary of the basic rules for contributors http://www.apache.org/dev/contributors.html ASF.
\\ For becoming a contributor, you have to be invited by the other contributors of the project. Having won merits and respect within the community.

\\ For a project, this is the previous step before become an Apache project. These projects are looking for create a hudge community and it's easier to become a contributor than in bigger projects from ASF.
\\

	\item \textit{Account creation} - step by step using ASF standards.
	\item \textit{Responsibilities} - as a member of ASF, personal web space, community, ApacheCon.
\end{itemize} You can find an extense explanation in \href{http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html}{ASF new committers guide}.
